# Next Steps for Native App Publishing

## ✅ What's Been Completed

### 1. Project Configuration
- ✅ Fixed TypeScript error in App.tsx
- ✅ Updated `app.json` with proper native app configuration
- ✅ Enhanced `eas.json` with comprehensive build profiles
- ✅ Added npm scripts for easy building and submission
- ✅ Created build automation script (`scripts/build-apps.sh`)
- ✅ Verified EAS CLI installation and login

### 2. App Configuration
- ✅ App name: "ShoutingFire"
- ✅ Bundle identifiers configured:
  - Android: `xyz.stevko.shoutingfireapp`
  - iOS: `xyz.stevko.shoutingfireapp`
- ✅ Permissions configured for audio streaming
- ✅ Background audio support enabled
- ✅ Privacy descriptions added for microphone/camera access

### 3. Build Profiles
- ✅ **Development**: For testing on devices
- ✅ **Preview**: For internal distribution
- ✅ **Production**: For app store submission

## 🚀 Immediate Next Steps

### 1. Test Development Builds
```bash
# Test Android development build
npm run build:android-dev

# Test iOS development build  
npm run build:ios-dev
```

### 2. Prepare App Store Assets
- [ ] Create app store screenshots for different device sizes
- [ ] Write app descriptions for both stores
- [ ] Prepare privacy policy URL
- [ ] Create feature graphics and promotional images

### 3. Set Up App Store Accounts
- [ ] Google Play Console account ($25 one-time fee)
- [ ] Apple Developer account ($99/year)
- [ ] Create app listings in both stores

## 📱 Build Commands

### Development Testing
```bash
# Android development build
npm run build:android-dev

# iOS development build
npm run build:ios-dev

# Both platforms
npm run build:all-dev
```

### Production Builds
```bash
# Android production build
npm run build:android-prod

# iOS production build
npm run build:ios-prod

# Both platforms
npm run build:all-prod
```

### App Store Submission
```bash
# Submit to Google Play Store
npm run submit:android

# Submit to Apple App Store
npm run submit:ios

# Submit to both stores
npm run submit:all
```

## 🎯 Recommended Workflow

### Phase 1: Testing (1-2 days)
1. Build development versions for both platforms
2. Test on physical devices
3. Verify audio streaming functionality
4. Test background audio playback
5. Check all app features work correctly

### Phase 2: App Store Preparation (2-3 days)
1. Create app store listings
2. Prepare all required assets
3. Write app descriptions
4. Set up privacy policy
5. Complete content rating questionnaires

### Phase 3: Production Build & Submit (1 day)
1. Build production versions
2. Submit to app stores
3. Monitor review process

## 📋 Important Notes

### Audio Streaming Considerations
- Your app streams live audio content
- Background audio playback is configured
- Audio permissions are properly set up
- Test audio functionality thoroughly on different devices

### App Store Guidelines
- Audio streaming apps may require additional review time
- Ensure content complies with store guidelines
- Be prepared to provide additional information if requested

### Version Management
- Current version: 1.0.0
- Android version code: 1
- iOS build number: 1
- Remember to increment these for each release
